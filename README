sxml
----

(Stupid XML Generator)

A simple class to generate XML without fuss. Born out of frustration
of entering XML data directly to C++ strings.


requirements
------------

C++ compiler and STL (sxml uses string, map, vector and stringstream
for formatting some values).


usage
-----

sxml is intended to be included directly in your source code tree.
As it consists of only one source file and one header file, that
shouldn't be impossible.

See the example.cpp file for simple usage, you should get the hang
of it pretty soon.
